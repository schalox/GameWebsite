                <h1>Story</h1>
                <p>TLDR: An alien named Anthony crashlands into Leppävaara. He meets Beth who will help him in his journey. He must find the ship's missing wing and collect mushrooms to create fuel for the return trip.</p>
                <p>The game starts when Anthony, our alien protagonist, is flying close to Earth while exploring the Milky Way. At the same time our antagonist Scientist Sam is experimenting with gamma rays. Sam’s experiments cause a malfunction in Anthony’s ship, causing it to crash into Earth, more specifically into Leppävaara in Southern Finland. The crash landing breaks Anthony’s ship in many ways making it unflyable. When Anthony steps out of his ship, it is greeted by Beth, an alien believer. She offers to help Anthony to repair its ship.</p>
                <p>First thing Anthony needs is a backpack. Beth happens to work in Varusteleka and can provide a backpack for Anthony. Beth also tells Anthony to wear clothes for disguise because it is being chased by a hunter. Beth picks out something from her store. After getting the backpack and clothes, Anthony begins its exploration in Leppävaara. After finding some useful spare parts Anthony hears couple of drunkards talking about hobo called Drunk Dave having found important part of Anthony’s ship. Anthony also hears that Drunk Dave lives in Korso, Vantaa. With the help of Beth Anthony manages to get to Korso and find Drunk Dave.</p>
                <p>Dave is willing to trade the ship part for liquor. Beth is still willing to help Anthony to get the liquor, but either of them don’t have any money. Beth tells Anthony the bottles are worth money. They collect bottles all around Vantaa and manage to get enough money for liquor. Beth goes to a liquor store, buys liquor and trades it for the ship part.</p>
                <p>Ship’s fuel supplies are almost empty, so Anthony must gather elements to create more. Luckily all the required elements can be found growing right here in Finland. Anthony collects all the elements and manages to create enough fuel for the journey back.</p>
                <p>Anthony thinks its friends and family won’t believe it when it tells them where he has been. At Beth’s suggestion, Anthony acquires a camera and takes a trip around Southern Finland to take pictures of some of its landmarks. Now Anthony has proof of where it’s been.</p>
                <p>Beth wants to take a photo of Anthony in Finland. While Beth is behind the camera Anthony gets captured by alien hunter Bob and is taken to Scientist Sam’s lab which also is in Leppävaara. Anthony has to escape from the lab by getting through doors and putting Bob and Sam to sleep.</p>
                <p>Anthony can safely return back to its ship where it meets with Beth. She has been waiting believing Alien could escape. Anthony returns the backpack to Beth and thanks her for all the help. Before leaving Beth yells Anthony to wait. Beth brings the camera to Anthony who takes it and tells Beth to visit if she’s ever in outer space. Anthony says final goodbyes and flies back to its home world. Anthony is reunited with its family, who were worried where it had gone. Anthony tells about the journey in Finland and it can show the pictures. Anthony says it’s looking forward for new adventures.
